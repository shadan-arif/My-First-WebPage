<H1> How Participants saw the Movement</H1><br></br>
</FONT>
<H3> Rich peasant communities </h3>
<UL>
<LI>Active in the movement.</LI>
<LI>Producers of commercial crops.</LI>
<LI>Hard hit by the falling prices. </LI>
<LI>Found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand.</LI>
<LI> Refusal to reduce the revenue demand led to widespread resentment.</LI>
<LI> Became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement
.</LI>
<LI>For them swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. </LI>
</UL>
<H3>Poorer peasantry </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Many of them were small tenants cultivating land
they had rented from landlords.</LI>

<H2>Limits of civil disobedience</h2>
<h3>Role of dalits </h3>
<ul>
<li> Congress had ignored the dalits</li>

<li> Swaraj would not come if
untouchability was not eliminated.</li>

<li>He called the ‘untouchables’ harijan 

<li>Organised satyagraha to secure them</li>

<LI>He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi (the
sweepers)

<li>He persuaded upper castes to change their heart and
give up ‘the sin of untouchability’.</LI>

<LI>But many dalit leaders were keen
on a different political solution to the problems of the community.</LI>

<LI>They began organising themselves

<lI> demanding reserved seats in
educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose
dalit members for legislative councils.</LI>



<li>Their participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was
 limited in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region
where their organisation was quite strong.</li>

</ul>

<h3>-Depressed Classes</h3>

<li>Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed
Classes Association in 1930

<li>Clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at
the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate
electorates for dalits. </li>



<li> Ghandhi Ji believed
that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of
their integration into society. </li>

<li>Ambedkar ultimately accepted his
position 

<li> It results the Poona Pact of September 1932.
</li>

<li>It gave the Depressed Classes  reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,

<lI>but they were to be voted in by the general electorate.</li>

<li> The dalit
movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of the Congress led
national movement.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Communal Parties</h3>
<li> Muslim political organisations in India were also
lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement.</li>

<li>
After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a
large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. </li>

<li> Congress came to be more visibly associated with
openly Hindu religious nationalist groups.</li>

<li> Each
community organised religious processions with militant fervour,
provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various
cities.</li>

<li> Every riot deepened the distance between the two communities.</li>
<br>
</br>
<li>The
 Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate
an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.</li>

<li>
The important differences were over the question of representation
in the future assemblies that were to be elected.</li>

<li> Muhammad AliJinnah, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, was willing to give
up the demand for separate electorates, if Muslims were assured
reserved seats in the Central Assembly.</LI>


<li>
When the Civil Disobedience Movement started there was thus
an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities.</li>

<li>
Alienated from the Congress, large sections of Muslims could not
respond to the call for a united struggle.</li>

<li> Many Muslim leaders and
intellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims
as a minority within India. </li>

<li>feared that the culture and identity
of minorities would be submerged under the domination of a
Hindu majority.</li>
