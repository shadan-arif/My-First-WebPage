<H2>Limits of civil disobedience</h2>
<h3>Role of dalits </h3>
<ul>
<li> Congress had ignored the dalits</li>

<li> Swaraj would not come if
untouchability was not eliminated.</li>

<li>He called the ‘untouchables’ harijan 

<li>Organised satyagraha to secure them</li>

<LI>He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi (the
sweepers)

<li>He persuaded upper castes to change their heart and
give up ‘the sin of untouchability’.</LI>

<LI>But many dalit leaders were keen
on a different political solution to the problems of the community.</LI>

<LI>They began organising themselves

<lI> demanding reserved seats in
educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose
dalit members for legislative councils.</LI>



<li>Their participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was
 limited in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region
where their organisation was quite strong.</li>

</ul>

<h3>-Depressed Classes</h3>

<li>Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed
Classes Association in 1930

<li>Clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at
the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate
electorates for dalits. </li>



<li> Ghandhi Ji believed
that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of
their integration into society. </li>

<li>Ambedkar ultimately accepted his
position 

<li> It results the Poona Pact of September 1932.
</li>

<li>It gave the Depressed Classes  reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,

<lI>but they were to be voted in by the general electorate.</li>

<li> The dalit
movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of the Congress led
national movement.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Communal Parties</h3>
<li>Some of the Muslim political organisations in India were also
lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement.</li>

<li>
After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a
large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. </li>

<li>From the
mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly associated with
openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha.</li>

<li>
As relations between Hindus and Muslims worsened, each
community organised religious processions with militant fervour,
provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various
cities.</li>

<li> Every riot deepened the distance between the two communities.</li>
<br>
</br>
<li>The
 Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate
an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.</li>

<li>
The important differences were over the question of representation
in the future assemblies that were to be elected.</li>

<li> Muhammad AliJinnah, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, was willing to give
up the demand for separate electorates, if Muslims were assured
reserved seats in the Central Assembly and representation in
proportion to population in the Muslim-dominated provinces (Bengal
and Punjab).</li>

<li> Negotiations over the question of representation
continued but all hope of resolving the issue at the All Parties
Conference in 1928 disappeared when M.R. Jayakar of the Hindu
Mahasabha strongly opposed efforts at compromise.</li>

<li>
When the Civil Disobedience Movement started there was thus
an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities.</li>

<li>
Alienated from the Congress, large sections of Muslims could not
respond to the call for a united struggle.</li>

<li> Many Muslim leaders and
intellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims
as a minority within India. </li>

<li>They feared that the culture and identity
of minorities would be submerged under the domination of a
Hindu majority.</li>
