<H1> How Participants saw the Movement</H1><br></br>

</FONT>

<H3> The Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh </h3>

<UL>

<LI> They were active in the movement.</LI>

<LI>They were producers of commercial crops.</LI>

<LI>They were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices. </LI>

<LI>Their cash income disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand.</LI>

<LI>The refusal of the government to reduce the revenue demand led to widespread resentment.</LI>

<LI>These rich peasants became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement,
organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members,
to participate in the boycott programmes.</LI>

<LI>For them the fight for swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply
disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without
the revenue rates being revised.</LI>

</UL>

<H3>Poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the
revenue demand.</H3>

<UL>

<LI>Many of them were small tenants cultivating land they had rented from landlords.</LI>

<LI> They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. </LI>

<LI>The Congress was unwilling to support ‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. 
So the relationship between the poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.</LI>

</UL>

<H3>- Business classes </H3>

<UL>

<LI> During the First World War, Indian merchants and industrialists had made huge profits and become powerful.</LI>

<LI>They wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage 
imports. </LI>

<LI>To organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the
 Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927.</LI>

<LI> Purshottamdas Thakurdas and G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian economy,
 and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was first launched. </LI>

<LI> They gave financial assistance and refused to buy or sell imported goods.</LI>

<LI> Most businessmen came to see swaraj as a time when colonial 
on business would no longer exist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints.</LI>

<LI>The failure of the Round Table Conference, business groups were no longer uniformly enthusiastic. </LI>

<LI> They were apprehensive of the spread of militant activities, 
and worried about prolonged disruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of 
socialism amongst the younger members of the Congress. </LI>

</UL>

<H3>-Industrial Working Class</H3>

<UL>

<LI> They  did not participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement in large numbers, except in the Nagpur region.</LI>

<LI> some workers did participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of the ideas of the 
Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign goods, as part of their own
movements against low wages and poor working conditions. </LI>

<LI>There were strikes by railway workers in 1930 and dockworkers in 1932</LI>

<LI>In 1930 thousands of workers in Chotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps</LI>

<LI>the Congress was reluctant to include workers’ demands as part of its programme of struggle. </LI>

<LI>It felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the antiimperial forces.</LI>

</UL>

<H3> Participation Of Women</H3>

<UL>

<LI> During Gandhiji’s salt march</LI>

<OL>
<LI>Women came out listen to him. </LI>

<LI> Participated in protest marches</LI>

<LI>Manufactured salt</LI>

<LI>Picketed foreign cloth</LI>

<LI>Picketed liquor shops </LI>

</OL>

<LI> In urban areas these women were from high-caste families;</LI>

<OL> <LI>In rural areas they came from rich peasant households.</LI>

<LI> Moved by Gandhiji’s call, they began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty of women. </LI></OL>

<LI> Gandhiji was convinced that it was the duty of women to look after home and hearth, be good mothers and good wives.</LI>

<LI>For a long time the Congress was reluctant to allow women to hold any position of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their symbolic presence.
